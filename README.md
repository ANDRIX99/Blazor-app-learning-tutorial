 Learning how to create blazor app

The project appears to be a standard Blazor WebAssembly app based on the file structure
Key files to examine:
BlazorApp.csproj (project configuration)
Program.cs (entry point)
App.razor (root component)
Pages/ (contains main pages)
wwwroot/ (contains static assets)
The project includes standard Blazor pages: Home, Counter, and Weather
We should also check the launchSettings.json for any specific configurations
Since there are many files, I'll use search_code to find relevant content for the README
